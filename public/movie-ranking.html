<h1>The Best Movies by Zub1Wun</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Bladerunner</h3>
<P>I have been watching this again and again since it came out. I never seem to get bored of watching it again. It's just so beautifully shot, every scene and dialogue is perfected. The perfect sequel to the original.</P>

<h3>My Neighbour Tortoro</h3>
<P>I've watched this countless times with my children, again I never seem to get bored of this. The innocence, the imagination and artistry in this is soo ahead of its time.</P>

<h3>Avengers: Infinity Wars</h3>
<P>Perhaps the best culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After this and it's sequal Endgame, it seems to have lost it's magic.</P>

<hr/>
