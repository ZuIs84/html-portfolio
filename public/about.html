<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Currently I am studying Web Development and Python. The website you see here is the result of my work going through Angela Yu's "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp". I enjoy making websites and hope to be able to make them for friends and families, as I know many people who could really benefit from having some good online presence through a personal website that really showcases their talents to the wider world.</p>

<p>Outside of IT I am a home-educating father of two, using Montessori and Classical Education principles as best as I can, as well as what I picked up from my experience working as a playworker, a Montessori classroom assistant and working in Special Educational Needs. I take my own personal learning very seriously, always looking into ways to better improve my own reading, writing and thinking abilities.</p>

<p>I have also always had a keen interest in martial arts, fitness training and learning to play musical instruments. I've studied karate as a child, then silat and kali illustrisimo, till progressing onto BJJ, wrestling & MMA. Currently I am learning to play the piano, guitar and violin.</p>
